Chrome extension for clean and faster gmail

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

## Why?
Gmail ships with lots of javascript and other assets and sometime it might be annoying to wait while
your gmail loads especially on a slower network. Their basic HTML view is really fast but it does not
appear polished. This extension styles basic html view of Gmail.
